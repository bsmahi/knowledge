Redis- It is an open source, advanced key-value store and an apt solution for building high performance, 
scalable web applications.

Redis has three main peculiarities that sets it apart.

1. Redis holds its database entirely in the memory, using the disk only for persistence.
2. Redis has a relatively rich set of data types when compared to many key-value data stores.
3. Redis can replicate data to any number of slaves.
