Redis- It is an open source, advanced key-value store and an apt solution for building high performance, 
scalable web applications.

Redis has three main peculiarities that sets it apart.

1. Redis holds its database entirely in the memory, using the disk only for persistence.
2. Redis has a relatively rich set of data types when compared to many key-value data stores.
3. Redis can replicate data to any number of slaves.

Advantages of Redis:

1. Exceptionally fast: Redis is very fast and can perform about 110000 SETs per second, about 81000 GETs per second.
2. Supports rich data types: Redis natively supports most of the datatypes that developers already know such as list, set,
sorted set, and hashes. This makes easy to solve a variety of problems as we know which problem can be handled better by which 
data type.
3. Operations are atomic - All Redis operations are atomic, which ensures that if two clients concurrently access, Redis server
will receive the updated value.
