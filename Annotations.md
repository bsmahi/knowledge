# Role of Annotations in Java

**Annotations** plays a pivotal role in programming language and reduces number of lines of code. It is simply to 
associate information with the annotated program element. We will be using annotations extensively in **Java, Spring and Hibernate, Web Service, Testing frameworks** and also in **[Javadoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc)** but many developers fail to understand on how annotations works internally and when it will invoke and available for a programm processing. Let me explain in detail about what is annotation, types of annotations and how they have used in many of the frameworks.

## Background
The Java Specifiication Request (JSR-175) introduced the general-purpose annotation (also known as metadata) facility to the Java Community Process in 2002. **Since JDK 1.5, annotations are available in the language**. The **apt(Annotation Processing Tool)** provided a provisional interface for compile-time annotation processing in JDK version 1.5; JSR-269 formalized this, and it became integrated into the javac compiler in version 1.6. *Annotation is special kind of Java construct used to decorate a class, method, field, parameter, variable, constructor, or package*.


## Definition
In the Java computer programming language, an annotation is a form of syntactic metadata that can be added to Java source code. **Classes, methods, variables, parameters** and Java packages may be annotated. Like Javadoc tags, Java annotations can be read from source files, it can also be embedded in and read from Java class files generated by the Java compiler. This allows annotations to be retained by the **Java Virtual Machine(JVM)** at **run-time** and read it via **reflection**. Sometimes it is possible to create meta annotations out of the existing ones in Java.
                                               
In simple words, *Annotation is Metadata* Metadata is data about data. So Annotations are metadata for code. 
Annotations are *meta-meta-objects* which can be used to describe other *meta-objects*. Meta-objects are classes, fields and methods. 

Annotations are used to provide supplement infromation about a program
  1. Annotations start with (@) (@ = AT, as in annotation type).
  2. Annotations do not change action of a compiled program.
  3. Annotations help to associate *metadata* (information) to the program elements i.e., instance variables, constructors,        methods, classes, etc.
  4. Annotations are not pure comments as they can change the way a program is treated by compiler.
